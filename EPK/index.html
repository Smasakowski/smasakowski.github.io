      <em>WIDELY REVERED</em> as one of New Orleans’ master jazz
      guitarists, <strong>Steve Masakowski</strong> has been a cornerstone of the city’s modern jazz scene since the 1970s.
      <br><br>
      Shaped by the musical wisdom of the elders with whom he frequently performed, toured and recorded, Steve quickly became one of the city’s leading modern jazz artists. He signed with <strong>Blue Note Records</strong> in the ’80s and eventually stepped into <strong>Ellis Marsalis’s</strong> shoes as <strong>Chair of the Jazz Studies Department at the University of New Orleans</strong>, where he mentored hundreds of young musicians over the decades, up until his retirement in 2022.
      <br><br>
      Now, as Steve turns 70, his kids wanted to honor that legacy the best way they know how: by making music together. This recording brings him full circle, with contributions from former students and longtime collaborators <strong>Blade, Rex Gregory, and Oscar Rossignoli,</strong>  as well as his children, <strong>Sasha and Martin</strong>. It’s both a celebration of his journey and a tribute to the music that’s always been at the heart of their family.
      <br><br>
      On <strong><em>TWO WORLDS</em></strong>, eight original compositions by Steve, Sasha, and Martin sit alongside <strong>James Blacks's</strong> timeless “A Love Song,” reaffirming New Orleans as a wellspring of modern standards. Together, the <strong>Masakowski Family</strong> adds their own chapter to the city’s living tradition: one that recognizes jazz music as a sacred heritage passed down through generations, while capturing its vibrant, ever-evolving future.

      <p>
        Patriarch <strong>Steve Masakowski</strong> has been a central figure in New Orleans jazz since the early 1980s. 
        A celebrated guitarist, composer, and founding member of the award-winning group Astral Project, 
        he has released numerous albums as a bandleader, including two on Blue Note Records, and has twice 
        been named “Best Guitarist” by Gambit and Offbeat, and has received Lifetime Achievement Awards 
        in both performance and music education. Steve has performed with legends such as Alvin “Red” Tyler, 
        Ellis Marsalis, Dr. Lonnie Smith, Danny Barker, James Black, Willie Tee, and Earl Turbinton, 
        as well as internationally acclaimed artists Bobby McFerrin, Nicholas Payton, Dave Liebman, 
        Allen Toussaint, and Dianne Reeves. For nearly 30 years, he served as the Coca-Cola Endowed Chair 
        of Jazz Studies at the University of New Orleans, mentoring generations of musicians while 
        publishing influential works, including <em>Jazz Ear Training</em> (Mel Bay).

      <p>
        Carrying this legacy forward are Steve’s children, Sasha and Martin Masakowski, each acclaimed artists 
        in their own right.

        Jazz vocalist, composer, and producer <Strong>Sasha Masakowski</Strong> has gained international recognition for her 
        fearless approach to jazz, blending electronic elements into both her performances and songwriting. 
        She has led projects such as Art Market and Tra$h Magnolia on stages around the world, from Blue Note NYC 
        and SFJAZZ to the Kennedy Center, Jazz at Lincoln Center Shanghai, Cotton Club Tokyo, Copenhagen Jazz Fest,

      <p>
        Bassist and luthier <Strong>Martin Masakowski</Strong> is known for his adventurous musicianship, fusing jazz with folk, 
        classical, electronic, North African, Eastern European, and Indian influences. Trained at NOCCA, the Rotterdam 
        Conservatory, and the University of New Orleans under his father’s mentorship, Martin was selected for the 
        U.S. State Department’s OneBeat residency (2016–17), after which he released the acclaimed album <em>Valley View</em> 
        with violinist Ira Echo. As a luthier, he designed the custom MAZ Bass travel instrument, expanding the double bass’s
